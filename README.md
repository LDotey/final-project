NBA logos : The Standard or Throw Back

Welcome to my NBA team selection app. This is a simple tool that compiles all NBA teams into two lists, based on their conference, within a simple basketball court setting. The framework of the app is the basis for a multitude of possibilites of disseminating data as well as engaging with user preference.
On page load, users will see a basketball court with empty 'Home' and 'Away' sides. Prompted by the drop down menus at the top of the page the user selects a team from either list to populate the Home and Away courts with the card of the selected team.
Team Cards show team name and team logo with an option to select a "throw back" logo.
Whether you are a basketball old head or just a fan of retro design this project takes a trip down memory lane with affection and humour.

The team data was sourced at https://www.balldontlie.io/api/v1/teams?page=1
